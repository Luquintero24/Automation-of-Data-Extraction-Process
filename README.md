# Automation-of-Data-Extraction-Process
# The project involves developing a data extraction and clustering system for processing diverse invoice formats. It leverages AWS services, machine learning algorithms, and PostgreSQL to extract and analyze key information from invoices. The system automates the identification of unique templates and clusters the data based on layout and content, streamlining the workflow for handling and organizing large volumes of invoices.
