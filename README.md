# The project involves developing a data extraction and clustering system for processing diverse invoice formats. Key components included AWS services like S3 for storing image data and Textract for extracting text. Docker was used for containerization, ensuring a consistent and scalable deployment environment. PostgreSQL, paired with SQLAlchemy, served as the database and ORM for efficient data storage and querying. Machine learning algorithms played a crucial role, with the TF-IDF Vectorizer used for text preprocessing and K-Means Clustering employed to categorize invoices into distinct templates. Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Boto3, and Pillow were integral for data manipulation, visualization, AWS interaction, and image processing.

# The use of these technologies resulted in a robust and scalable system that significantly streamlined the process of handling diverse invoice formats. By automating the extraction and organization of invoice data, the project reduced manual effort and enhanced accuracy. The experience provided invaluable hands-on learning in cloud computing, data processing, and machine learning, while also reinforcing the importance of a systematic approach to problem-solving in real-world applications. The system automates the identification of unique templates and clusters the data based on layout and content, streamlining the workflow for handling and organizing large volumes of invoices.
